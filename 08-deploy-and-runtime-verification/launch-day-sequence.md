## Launch Sequence (Automated)

### Step 1: Final Deploy + Purge

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
curl -s -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$CF_ZONE_ID/purge_cache" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_API_TOKEN" --data '{"purge_everything":true}'
sleep 5
```

### Step 2: Ensure Search Engines Can Crawl

```bash
# Verify robots.txt allows crawling
curl -s "https://domain.com/robots.txt" | grep "Allow: /"
# Verify sitemap exists and is valid XML
curl -s "https://domain.com/sitemap.xml" | head -5
```

### Step 3: Submit Sitemap to Google Search Console

```bash
# Via GSC API (GCP service account required)
curl -X PUT "https://www.googleapis.com/webmasters/v3/sites/https%3A%2F%2Fdomain.com/sitemaps/https%3A%2F%2Fdomain.com%2Fsitemap.xml" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GSC_TOKEN"

# Or via ping (no auth needed)
curl "https://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://domain.com/sitemap.xml"
```

### Step 4: GitHub Auto-Config

```bash
gh repo edit --description "$(curl -s https://domain.com | grep -oP '(?<=<meta name="description" content=")[^"]*')"
gh repo edit --homepage "https://domain.com"
gh repo edit --add-topic "cloudflare,hono,emdash,typescript"
```

### Step 5: Generate README (09/documentation-and-codebase-hygiene)

Auto-generate branded README with install.doctor template, aqua dividers, badges.

### Step 6: Social Announcement (09/social-automation)

```bash
# Auto-post via Postiz
curl -X POST "https://postiz.megabyte.space/api/posts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTIZ_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Just shipped: domain.com — [product description]",
    "platforms": ["twitter", "linkedin"],
    "media": ["https://domain.com/og/homepage.png"],
    "schedule": "now"
  }'
```

### Step 7: Launch Email (09/email-templates)

Send branded launch announcement via Amazon SES to newsletter subscribers (if Listmonk is set up).

### Step 8: Production E2E Suite

```bash
PROD_URL=https://domain.com npx playwright test
```

### Step 9: Cross-Browser Smoke (first deploy only)

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium --project=firefox --project=webkit
```

### Step 10: Final Report

```markdown
## Launch Report — domain.com
### Status: ✅ LIVE
- URL: https://domain.com
- Deploy: [timestamp]
- Lighthouse: [score]
- E2E: [pass/fail]
- Sitemap: submitted to GSC
- Social: posted to [platforms]
- README: generated

### What Was Built
- [feature list]

### Next Steps
- [improvements from idea engine — 14-independent-idea-engine]
```

### Step 11: Notify Connected Services

```typescript
// Slack deploy notification
await notifySlack(env, `🚀 *${domain}* is LIVE\n<https://${domain}|Visit site>\nBuilt with projectsites.dev`);

// Discord community notification (if applicable)
await notifyDiscord(env, `${domain} launched!`, `Check it out: https://${domain}`);

// Zapier webhook (triggers any connected automations)
await triggerZapier(env, 'site_launched', { domain, url: `https://${domain}` });
```

### Step 12: Psychology-Optimized Launch (04/wisdom-and-human-psychology)

- **Peak-End Rule** — the launch announcement IS the peak moment. Make it count.
- **Social Proof** — include user count or testimonial in the social post
- **Reciprocity** — share something valuable in the announcement (tip, insight, free tool)
- **Unity** — frame as "we built this" not "I built this" — shared identity with community

### Brand Amplification

Every launch amplifies the projectsites.dev brand:

- Social posts mention "Built with projectsites.dev" when appropriate
- README includes projectsites.dev badge
- Footer includes projectsites.dev attribution
- The quality of the launch IS the marketing
