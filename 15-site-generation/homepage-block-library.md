# Homepage Block Library — 50 Distinct Feature-Block Types

Canonical block taxonomy for `template.projectsites.dev` homepage composition. Every generated site picks 8–14 blocks from this library, ordered narratively (hero → trust → problem → solution → proof → action → closer). Each block is a standalone, self-contained React component in `src/components/blocks/<kebab-slug>.tsx` with its own data prop interface. Builds compose via `blocksManifest.json` at the site level — order is per-site, blocks are universal.

## Tier 1 — Hero / Above-the-Fold (pick 1)

2. **`hero-video-loop`** — Full-bleed muted autoplay 12-30s b-roll; `<source>` AV1+H.264; LQIP poster; ASCII-art fallback for `prefers-reduced-motion`; headline+CTA overlay with reduced-opacity gradient.
3. **`hero-mission-statement`** — Single centered 14-word manifesto sentence, oversized type (`clamp 4rem-9rem`), animated word-by-word reveal (View Transitions or CSS `@starting-style`), no image — pure typographic poster.

## Composition Rules (apply per site)

- **Maximum 14 blocks per homepage** — Longer homepages decay; ruthlessly cut to top performers.
- **Always include** — 1 hero, 1 trust, 1 mission, 1 services, 1 impact, 1 action, 1 closer. 7-block minimum.
- **Block order = narrative arc** — hero → trust → problem framing → solution → proof → conversion → closer. Never lead with conversion.
- **Block uniqueness** — Never repeat block-type slugs on a single homepage. Variation across the page beats repetition.
- **Mobile collapse rules** — Every block must define `mobile`, `tablet`, `desktop` variants. Mobile rarely needs more than 6 blocks visible above the fold-equivalent.
- **Accessibility floor** — Every block ships WCAG 2.2 AA, 4.5:1 contrast, full keyboard nav, 24px touch targets, `prefers-reduced-motion` honored.
- **Performance budget per block** — ≤30KB JS gz, ≤15KB CSS gz, ≤200KB media. Hero gets a larger budget (400KB media); blocks below the fold use IntersectionObserver lazy-mount.
- **Citation rule** — Any block surfacing a statistic (`stat-block-grid`, `live-impact-ticker`, `year-over-year-chart`, `comparison-table-need-vs-supply`) MUST carry inline `<Citation refId="...">` markers, with the page-level `<PageReferences>` rendering at page bottom. See `09-brand-and-content-system/build-breaking-rules.md` for the references rule.

## Implementation Pattern (per block)

```tsx
// src/components/blocks/<slug>.tsx
export interface <Slug>Props { /* fully typed data prop */ }
export function <Slug>({ data }: { data: <Slug>Props }) { /* … */ }
export const <slug>BlockMeta = {
  slug: '<slug>',
  category: 'hero' | 'trust' | 'problem' | 'services' | 'impact' | 'action' | 'proof' | 'closer' | 'specialty',
  tier: 1-9,
  cssBudgetKbGz: number,
  jsBudgetKbGz: number,
  mediaBudgetKb: number,
  requiresCitations: boolean,
} as const;
```

Per-site homepage definition (`src/data/homepage-blocks.ts`):

```ts
export const homepageBlocks: HomepageBlock[] = [
  { slug: 'hero-impact-counter', props: { /* per-site data */ } },
  { slug: 'accreditation-strip', props: { /* … */ } },
  { slug: 'stat-block-grid', props: { /* … */ } },
  // …
];
```

`<HomepageRenderer blocks={homepageBlocks} />` iterates and dynamic-imports each block lazily.

## Reference

- Brian (2026-05-11): *"what are 50 different types of feature blocks we can add to the homepage of the website that we might want to build into template.projectsites.dev?"* — this file is the canonical answer; new block types append here, never inline elsewhere.
- Pairs with `15-site-generation/template-system.md` (composition engine) + `15-site-generation/build-breaking-rules.md` (block-level quality gates).
