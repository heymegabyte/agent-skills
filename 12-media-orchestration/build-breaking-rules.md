# 12 — Build-Breaking Media + Orchestration Rules

> **Model migration note (pass-75, 2026-06-09)**: References to `DALL-E 3` / `DALL-E` migrated to **GPT Image 2** (2026-04; 2.5 branded 2026-09 — check current API id at integration); `GPT-4o` vision migrated to **GPT Image 2 vision** (current OpenAI multimodal flagship). Per `platform.openai.com/docs/deprecations`: DALL-E 2/3 removed from API 2026-05-12; GPT-4o retired 2026-02-13. 14-Ideogram leverage slot manifest, 16-source parallel multimedia fan-out, and topic-relevance ≥8/10 gates all unchanged — only API endpoint names updated. Cost ranges in this doc were computed against legacy DALL-E + GPT-4o pricing; re-verify against current GPT Image 2 rates.

Migrated from `~/.claude/rules/always.md` 2026-05-03.

## Every image slot (***MEDIA SLOT MANIFEST + FAIL-CLOSED AUTO-REGENERATE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — supersedes "fetch-some-images-and-pick-later" patterns***)

- Phase 0 step 1 enumerates EVERY image slot on EVERY route into `_media_slots.json` BEFORE any agent fans out.

### Slot record shape

```
{slot_id, route, section, role, aspect, min_dims, topic_keywords, topic_intent,
 brand_palette, preferred_motion, source_chain, dalle_prompt, negative_prompt,
 relevance_floor, filled_by, filled_url, filled_score, regen_attempts}
```

### Per-slot GPT Image 2 prompt — 6 mandatory fields

- Drafted in a single batched GPT Image 2 vision call (~$0.05/site). MUST encode:
  1. Page topic + intent verbatim
  2. Brand palette tokens inline hex
  3. Composition + aspect ratio
  4. Subject specificity (NEVER `"people"` — always `"octogenarian volunteer plating soup, soft window light, documentary style"`)
  5. Photographic technical specs (camera/lens/lighting/DoF — e.g. `"shot on Hasselblad, 85mm prime, golden hour, shallow DoF"`)
  6. Negative prompt block (`"no text, no watermarks, no logos, no extra fingers, no AI artifacts, no stock-photo cliches"`)

### Source-chain order

1. Real-entity sources (Places/uploads/scrape)
2. GPT Image 2
3. Pexels
4. Coverr
5. Flux
6. Brand-gradient

- GPT Image 2 is PRIMARY slot-fill engine after real-entity exhaustion. Stock APIs run as parallel speed-pass fallback (instant return if GPT Image 2 hangs >15s) but GPT Image 2 output preferred at curation.

### Acceptance

- Every slot MUST end with `filled_url != null AND filled_score >= relevance_floor` (default 8/10 GPT Image 2 vision).

### Failure handling

- Failure (Pexels empty, NSFW flag, broken scrape, vision below floor) → REFINED-prompt regen via GPT Image 2 (`(original_prompt, vision_critique, relevance_floor)`), max 5 attempts × $0.08/img = $0.40/slot worst case.
- After exhaustion: log to `_unfillable_slots.json`, ship brand-gradient floor, mark `published_with_warnings`, surface slot for manual replacement.
- NEVER silent skip. NEVER substitute brand-gradient unless 5 regen attempts exhausted.

### Validators

- `validate-media-slot-manifest.mjs` — every route enumerated, every slot record complete
- `validate-no-empty-slots.mjs` — no `_unfillable_slots.json` entries on clean build, no slot below relevance_floor, no fallback-gradient unless exhaustion logged
- `validate-dalle-slot-fill.mjs` — every GPT Image 2 prompt has all 6 mandatory fields
- Daily GPT Image 2 spend tracked in `_dalle_daily.json` against `OPENAI_DAILY_BUDGET` (default $50) — exhaustion triggers Flux fallback for remainder of day.

## Every site (***NOTEBOOKLM ARTIFACTS — PODCAST + INFOGRAPHIC + EXPLAINER VIDEO — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — `notebooklm-orchestrator` agent runs Phase 0***)

Every site ships THREE auto-generated NotebookLM-style artifacts before deploy:

1. **Two-host audio podcast** — rendered on `/about` via `<audio>` Plyr embed + collapsible inline transcript + dual JSON-LD (`PodcastSeries` + `PodcastEpisode` with `partOfSeries` + `associatedMedia` + `transcript`) + RSS feed `/podcast.xml` (RSS 2.0 + iTunes namespace + podcast namespace 1.0, `<enclosure type="audio/mpeg">` + `<itunes:duration>` + `<podcast:transcript>` + `<podcast:chapters>`) + 3000×3000 JPEG cover art (Apple-required)
2. **Infographic gallery** — rendered on `/about` via `[data-infographic-gallery]` containing ≥3 panels (mandatory mix: 1 data chart via Vega-Lite SVG from `_research.json.stats[]` + 1 process/flow panel via Recraft v3 SVG + 1 hero illustration via GPT Image 2 PNG with brand-converged per-slot prompt encoding all 6 mandatory fields per skill 12), each panel `data-zoomable` + `data-gallery="infographic"` + `data-caption-title` + `data-caption-description` per always.md "Every multi-image section" rule
3. **Explainer video** — rendered BTF (second `<section>` inside `<main>`, immediately after hero) on `/` homepage via `[data-section="explainer-btf"]` containing `<stream src="<UID>" controls preload="metadata" poster="<R2>" primary-color="<brand-accent>" defaultTextTrack="en">` (Cloudflare Stream embed) + `<figcaption>` + collapsible inline transcript + JSON-LD `VideoObject` with `name` + `description` + `thumbnailUrl` + `contentUrl` + `embedUrl` + `uploadDate` + `duration` + `transcript` + `hasPart` chapters array (3-7 `Clip` entries with `startOffset` + `endOffset` + `url#t=N`)

- Phase 0 step 2 enumerates `_notebooklm.json` manifest (mirrors Media Slot Manifest pattern) BEFORE Phase 1 page builds reference artifact URLs.

### Provider chains

- **Podcast** — ElevenLabs Studio Create Podcast (`POST /v1/studio/podcasts` with `mode: conversation` + two voice IDs) → AutoContent API → `teng-lin/notebooklm-py` headless wrapper (only when client demands NotebookLM-format proof) → skip-with-warning
- **Video** — HeyGen API (USD wallet since Feb-2026; Avatar IV ~$3/min Photo / ~$4/min Digital-Twin 1080p, Video Agent ~$2/min; 60-90s ≈ $3-6) → Synthesia → Tavus → Veo 3.1 Fast 8s hero loop → skip-with-warning
- **Infographic** — Vega-Lite (free deterministic) + Recraft v3 ($0.04/SVG) + GPT Image 2 ($0.06/img); fallback to Napkin AI ($39/mo) when Recraft + GPT-Image saturated

### Budgets

- Per-site cost ceiling — $3.50
- Daily ceiling — `NOTEBOOKLM_DAILY_BUDGET` (default $300 = ~100 sites) — exhaustion degrades to cheapest providers, NEVER blocks deploy

### Acceptance

- Every artifact MUST end with `filled_url != null AND filled_score >= 8/10` (GPT Image 2 vision for cover art, gpt-4o-mini topical-relevance for transcript) OR exhausted-with-warning state — max 3 attempts per artifact.

### Source brief construction

- gpt-4o-mini condenses `_research.json` + top-N `_corpus.json` + `_pdf_facts.json` into 8-15K-char `_podcast_source.md`; same brief feeds 75-second `_video_script.md` synthesis (gpt-4o, structured Hook 10s → Problem 15s → Solution 30s → Proof 10s → CTA 10s).

### Submission automation (post-deploy)

- Apple Podcasts Connect (JWT API, `APPLE_PODCAST_KEY_ID` + `APPLE_PODCAST_PRIVATE_KEY`)
- Spotify for Podcasters (manual UI)
- Podcast Index (free instant `https://podcastindex.org/add`)
- Amazon Music Podcasters
- YouTube Music podcast directory (Google Podcasts deprecated 2024)

### Validators

- `validate-podcast-on-about.mjs` — `<audio>` + dual JSON-LD + transcript ≥500 chars on `/about`
- `validate-infographic-on-about.mjs` — `[data-infographic-gallery]` ≥3 panels with caption attrs on `/about`
- `validate-explainer-video-btf.mjs` — `[data-section="explainer-btf"]` is 2nd `<section>` of `<main>` on `/` + `<stream>` + VideoObject JSON-LD with hasPart chapters
- `validate-podcast-rss.mjs` — `/podcast.xml` 200 + valid RSS 2.0 + ≥1 `<item>` with audio enclosure

Pipeline spec: `~/.agentskills/12-media-orchestration/notebooklm-pipeline.md`. Agent: `~/.claude/agents/notebooklm-orchestrator.md`.

## Every page-rendered image (***TOPIC-RELEVANCE GATE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — vision-LLM scored***)

- Every `<img>` on a route MUST score ≥8/10 on per-page semantic relevance via GPT Image 2 vision scoring: (a) page topic + intent, (b) image subject + composition, (c) brand-tone fit.
- Lightbulb on `/volunteer` = fail. Mixed-gender adults on `women-and-children-services` = fail. Generic corporate handshake on soup-kitchen page = fail.

### Hero image preference order (STRICT)

1. Original-source-hero IF quality ≥7/10
2. Pexels-video-loop matching topic
3. Pexels-image scoring ≥8
4. GPT Image 2 per-slot prompt naming page topic + brand palette + subject specificity
5. Brand-gradient fallback

- Validator (`validate-image-relevance.mjs`): post-build GPT Image 2 vision scores `(page_topic, image_description) → relevance 0-10` for every image on every route; FAIL any score <8.

## Every blog/article post (***FEATURED IMAGE MANDATORY + GPT Image 2 FALLBACK — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every page-rendered image"***)

- Every blog/news/article/journal/case-study post MUST have a valid featured image (hero + OG card + listing thumbnail).

### Discovery chain

1. Source post `<img>` with class containing `featured`/`hero`/`thumb`
2. Source post first inline `<img>` ≥1024×768
3. Source post `og:image` meta
4. Source post `twitter:image` meta
5. Pexels search by post title keywords (≥3 stop-word-filtered nouns)
6. Pixabay search same keywords
7. GPT Image 2 generation with per-slot prompt naming: (a) post topic + 3 most-relevant nouns from title; (b) brand palette inline hex; (c) 16:9 aspect for hero / 1.91:1 for OG / 4:3 for listing thumbnail; (d) photographic specs (`"editorial photography, soft natural light, shallow DoF, documentary style"`); (e) negative prompt block (no text, no watermarks, no logos, no AI artifacts)

- When source-post-image is broken (404 / 5xx / mixed-content / blocked CDN), SKIP that source and continue chain — never ship a broken `<img>`.
- Vision-LLM scores final image ≥8/10 topic relevance before accepting; below 8 → regen with refined prompt up to 3 attempts.
- Validator (`validate-blog-featured-images.mjs`): every `_corpus.json.posts[]` entry MUST have `featured_image_url` set to a 200-OK file in build output; every `<article>` tile MUST have `<img>` ≥1024×768; OG card 1200×630 ≤100KB.

## Every migrated source-site asset (***R2 SELF-HOSTING — NEVER HOTLINK SQUARESPACE/WIX/WP CDNS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

- Every image/video/PDF/font/CSS/JS reference inherited from the source site MUST be downloaded during scrape and re-uploaded to R2 under `sites/<slug>/assets/<deterministic-hash>.<ext>` BEFORE rebuild reaches `published`.
- NEVER ship: `<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/...">`, `<img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/...">`, `<img src="https://wp.com/...">`, `<source src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/<id>">` (YouTube embeds OK as iframes; raw assets NOT).
- YouTube/Vimeo iframes preserved as-is (intentional embeds, not asset hotlinks).

### Pipeline

1. Crawler enumerates all asset URLs into `_assets.json.external_refs[]`
2. Parallel `fetch` with REAL_UA + `Accept-Encoding: identity` for binary integrity
3. Compute SHA-256 → store under `sites/<slug>/assets/<hash>.<ext>`
4. Rewrite all dist HTML/CSS to point to `/assets/<hash>.<ext>`
5. Augment with augmented assets per skill 12 media-acquisition

- Validator (`validate-no-cdn-hotlinks.mjs`): grep dist/ HTML for hostnames matching `squarespace-cdn|squarespace.com|wixstatic|wix.com|wp.com|wpcomstaging|files.wordpress|cdn.shopify|images.weserv|res.cloudinary` — any match outside whitelist (analytics, fonts, Google CSE) = fail.

## Every page (media density — ***FAVOR VIDEO + MULTI-SOURCE GENERATION***)

Every page receives at minimum:

1. ALL original media from corresponding source URL (images, videos, PDFs preserved)
2. 1-2 supplemental GPT Image 2 / GPT-Image purpose-crafted originals (per-slot prompts per skill 12)
3. ≥1 Pexels Video API result for hero/module background (`<video autoplay muted loop playsinline poster>`)
4. Google Image Search top-3 HIGHLY-relevant images filtered by topic match score (vision-LLM ≥8)

- Hero background preference order: original-source-hero-image → Pexels-video-loop → Pexels-image → GPT Image 2-generated → solid-brand-gradient. Never ship a hero with no media.

## Every image (***BUSINESS-TYPE SEMANTIC MISMATCH — FAIL CLOSED — extends topic-relevance gate — BUILD-BREAKING***)

- GPT Image 2 vision topic-relevance ≥8/10 is necessary but NOT sufficient. A second binary check MUST run: "Is this image physically compatible with what a `<business_type>` business would show?"
- E.g. clothing/shirts on a box factory = fail; ambulance on a bakery = fail; tropical beach on an accounting firm = fail.
- Prompt: (a) business category from `_research.json.category`; (b) business type description from `_research.json.business_type_description`; (c) vision description of image. Answer YES/NO — any NO → regen with prompt refinement.
- Build gate (`validate-business-type-image-match.mjs`): every `[data-slot]` image runs a GPT Image 2 vision-mini YES/NO category-fit call — any NO = fail with slot ID, image URL, and rejection reason.

## Every site rebuild with known source domain (***PRIMARY DOMAIN MEDIA EXTRACTION MANDATORY — BEFORE ANY AI GENERATION***)

- Before invoking GPT Image 2 or any stock API, crawler MUST fully extract ALL media from the source business domain.

### Extraction pipeline

1. Firecrawl/Playwright deep crawl primary domain with REAL_UA
2. Extract every `<img src>`, `<picture>`, `<video poster>`, `<source src>`, CSS `background-image` URL, `og:image`, JSON `image` fields
3. Filter: keep ≥200×200px, ≥10KB, non-icon/sprite/tracking-pixel
4. Download + R2 self-host (never hotlink)
5. Run every extracted image through GPT Image 2 vision topic-relevance + business-type-match gate
6. Target: `source_image_count × 1.5` minimum total images in build

- NEVER start AI image generation until step 5 exhausted. `_media_slots.json` MUST show `filled_by: "source_extract"` for every slot filled by real extraction before `filled_by: "dalle"` or `filled_by: "pexels"` slots.
- Validator (`validate-source-media-extraction.mjs`): when `_research.json.source_domain` set, assert `_assets.json.extracted_images.length >= 1`.

## Every team headshot (***1:1 SQUARE CROP + CONSISTENT STYLE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

- (a) Square aspect ratio (1:1), face centered, cropped at shoulder level — never portrait (4:5, 3:4) or landscape unless the full team page uses a SINGLE consistent non-square format.
- (b) Consistent style across ALL team members (same background tone, crop framing, shadow/border treatment) — never a mix of office photos + LinkedIn headshots + casual outdoor shots in the same grid.
- (c) Resolution ≥400×400px source, served at 200×200 minimum rendered size.
- (d) When source site has real headshots: download, AI-crop to 1:1 (Sharp `gravity: 'face'` or `sharp().resize(600,600,{fit:'cover', position:'face'})`), upload to R2.
- (e) When source has NO headshot: GPT Image 2 generates a professional headshot — prompt: `"Professional headshot of [gender]-presenting person in [industry-appropriate attire], neutral gray background, soft studio lighting, 1:1 square crop, photorealistic, Hasselblad quality, no text, no watermarks"` — NEVER ship a team card without a photo.
- (f) Face detection required — if Sharp face-detect returns 0 faces, reject and regenerate.
- Validator (`validate-team-headshots.mjs`): for every `[data-card-type=person]`, assert `<img>` natural aspect ratio between 0.9 and 1.1 AND rendered bounding-rect is square within 5%.

## Every listing-grid image (***CONSISTENT ASPECT RATIO WITHIN GRID — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

- All `<img>` elements within a single `[data-card-grid]` MUST share the SAME aspect ratio — 16:9 OR 4:3 OR 1:1 (portraits → 1:1; products → 4:3; hero/feature → 16:9).
- All images cropped to the grid's target aspect using Sharp `fit:'cover'` BEFORE upload to R2 — never CSS-cropped via `object-fit: cover` alone without actual crop.
- Each `<figure>` uses CSS `aspect-ratio: 16/9` (or equivalent) as a size placeholder.
- Validator (`validate-grid-image-aspect.mjs`): for every `[data-card-grid]`, compute `getBoundingClientRect()` of each `<img>` inside — if `max(width/height) - min(width/height) > 0.05` across images = fail.

## Every page render (***ALT-TEXT DEDUP BAN — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

- No two `<img>` elements on the same rendered route may share identical alt text (case-insensitive, whitespace-normalized).
- Template ships `src/lib/altText.ts` with `dedupeAltText<T>(assets)` that appends caption/context suffix on duplicate, and `findDuplicateAlts<T>()` for validation. `deriveAltFromSrc(src)` provides last-resort titleization fallback.
- Every loop rendering `<img>` from a data array MUST pipe the array through `dedupeAltText()` before mapping to JSX — never `.map(a => <img alt={a.alt} />)` raw.
- Validator (`validate-alt-dedup.mjs`): per-route DOM walk extracts every `<img alt>`, normalizes, fails on any duplicate AND on any empty alt that lacks `role="presentation"` or `aria-hidden="true"`.

## Every route (***PER-ROUTE OG IMAGE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

- Every route MUST have a UNIQUE `og:image` and matching `twitter:image` — no shared site-wide `og-image.png` across routes. Each card is 1200×630 ≤100KB branded composition naming the page topic in headline + branded background + logomark + accent gradient.

### Discovery chain for per-route OG image

1. When route has a hero image meeting topic-relevance ≥8/10, composite hero into 1200×630 with branded gradient overlay + page title text + logomark
2. Else render branded card via Satori/Resvg SSR or Vercel OG Image API or Bannerbear API with template tokens `{title, eyebrow, accent, logo}` per `_brand.json`
3. Fallback: site-default OG card logged to `_unfillable_og.json` for manual replacement

- File path: `sites/<slug>/og/<route-hash>.png` (deterministic — `sha256(route)` first 8 chars).
- `og:image` MUST point to absolute URL; `og:image:width = 1200`; `og:image:height = 630`; `og:image:type = image/png`; `og:image:alt = "<page-specific-description>"`.
- Validator (`validate-route-og-image.mjs`): every route has og:image set; every og:image URL is unique across routes; every og:image URL HEAD-200 resolves; image dimensions exactly 1200×630; file size ≤100KB. Same checks apply to `twitter:image`.

## Every inline SVG in dist/ (***SVGO COMPRESSED — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

- All `<svg>` elements embedded inline in HTML or referenced as SVG files MUST pass SVGO optimization as a build step. Expected size reduction: 30-60%.
- Build pipeline MUST run `npx svgo --multipass` on all `.svg` source files AND on all `<svg>` blocks extracted from template HTML before final bundle.

### SVGO config

```js
{ plugins: ["preset-default", { name: "removeViewBox", active: false }] }
```

- Validator (`validate-svgo.mjs`): compute ratio `svgo_size / original_size` for every `.svg` in dist/ — if ratio >0.85 (less than 15% reduction), flag for review; if ratio === 1.0 (no optimization ran) = fail.

## Every page rendering a street address (***PROGRESSIVE-ENHANCEMENT MAPS CONTEXT — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every site with a physical address"***)

- Every page that visually renders a street address (any `<address>` element OR `<AddressBlock>` OR string matching `\d+ [A-Z][a-z]+ (Street|St|Avenue|Ave|Road|Rd|Blvd|Lane|Ln|Drive|Dr)` rendered as page content — NOT just footer ambient NAP) MUST present that address with adjacent Google Maps visual context within the same DOM section.
- Progressive enhancement — keep `<address>` element + dir-link, ADD the visual.
- Required adjacency: map widget within same `<section>` or `<aside>` as the address OR within 1 viewport scroll on mobile (≤700px after the address).

### Three approved widget tiers

1. **MapTile** — 320×320 lazy-mounted thumbnail with one pin, `aspect-ratio: 1/1`; used inline beside contact cards / in `/we-need` tiles / service-page callouts (≤30KB rendered)
2. **MapBand** — full-bleed 16:9 or 21:9 banner with directions CTA overlay; used on `/contact` + service-detail pages + section dividers
3. **MapDossier** — split-screen 50/50 address+hours+phone left, interactive map right; used on `/contact` hero and "where to find us" features

- `<MapWidget variant="tile|band|dossier" address geo title aspectRatio>` shipped once in `src/components/map-widget.tsx`, never duplicated.
- Lazy-mount via IntersectionObserver — iframe injected only when section enters viewport. Placeholder: Sharp-rendered Maps Static API PNG OR brand-gradient SVG with pin glyph. Reduced-motion: no autoplay pan, static initial frame.
- NO MORE THAN 2 distinct map widgets per route; when 2 addresses on same page, single widget with 2 pins via `&q=` polyline encoding OR `place_id`.
- Same-page `LocalBusiness` / `Place` / `Organization` JSON-LD MUST include `geo: { latitude, longitude }` matching embed coords within 50m.
- Validator (`validate-address-map-adjacency.mjs`): for every page rendering an address, assert: (a) `<MapWidget>` OR `<iframe src*="google.com/maps/embed">` OR `<img src*="maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap">` OR `<noscript>` map fallback within same `<section>`/`<aside>`; (b) map widget count per route ≤2; (c) `LocalBusiness.geo` JSON-LD present. Fail codes: `address.map_adjacency_missing` | `address.map_widget_excess` | `address.geo_jsonld_missing`.
- **Footer NAP exemption** — the always-present footer-block address requires only the single small footer embed — does NOT trigger per-section adjacency rule.

## Every site with a physical address (***FULL-WIDTH GOOGLE MAPS WIDGET — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING for local-business + non-profit + restaurant + medical + retail + any site with NAP***)

- Every site whose `_research.json` resolves a street address renders ONE full-width interactive map widget on `/contact` (mandatory) AND mirrors a smaller embed in the footer (recommended).
- MUST use Google Maps Embed API via `<iframe>` (no JS-API key required for basic embeds, free unlimited loads, no CSP `script-src` change needed) — NOT the Maps JavaScript API.

URL pattern:

```
https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=<MAPS_EMBED_KEY>&q=<urlencoded-address>&zoom=15&maptype=roadmap
```

- `MAPS_EMBED_KEY` set via `wrangler secret put MAPS_EMBED_KEY --env production`.
- `<MapWidget>` must include: `loading="lazy"`, `referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"`, `allowfullscreen`, `aria-label="Interactive map showing <address>"`, wrapped in `<figure>` with `<figcaption>` linking the address.
- `<noscript>` fallback renders Maps Static API image: `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=<lat>,<lng>&zoom=15&size=1200x675&markers=color:red%7C<lat>,<lng>&key=<MAPS_STATIC_KEY>`.
- For DASHBOARD CSP: append `frame-src https://www.google.com https://maps.google.com`.
- `LocalBusiness` JSON-LD on same page MUST include `geo: { @type: "GeoCoordinates", latitude, longitude }` matching embed coords exactly (rounded to 5 decimals = ~1.1m precision).
- Mapbox GL JS alternative when `_brand.json.theme==="dark" AND brand_consistency_priority>0.8` (50k loads/month free, requires `MAPBOX_TOKEN`).
- When `_brand.json.theme === "dark"` AND Mapbox NOT chosen, wrap `<iframe>` in `<div class="map-wrapper" data-theme="dark">` and apply: `filter: invert(90%) hue-rotate(180deg) saturate(0.5) contrast(1.1);`

### Custom logo marker pin

- When `_research.json.address_lat` + `_research.json.address_lng` known AND `_brand.json.logo.original_icon_url` resolves HEAD-200: download logo icon; Sharp composite — 80×80 white circle bg, logo centered 50×50, SVG downward-pointing triangle 20×20 as pin stem (brand accent color); save as `sites/<slug>/assets/map-marker.png`; upload to R2; append `&markers=icon:<absolute-r2-url-to-marker>%7C<lat>,<lng>` to Embed URL OR inject via Mapbox `addImage`+`addLayer`.
- Fallback: `&markers=color:red%7C<lat>,<lng>` when logo unavailable.
- Validator (`validate-google-maps-widget.mjs`): for every site with `_research.json.address` set, assert: (a) `<iframe src*="google.com/maps/embed">` OR `<div data-mapbox>` present on `/contact`; (b) iframe `width` resolves to ≥90vw at desktop; (c) `LocalBusiness.geo` lat/lng matches embed `q` resolved coords within 50m; (d) when `_brand.json.theme==="dark"`, iframe has `filter` style applied. Fail codes: `map.embed_missing` | `map.not_full_width` | `map.geo_mismatch` | `map.dark_theme_filter_missing`.

## Every page (***MULTIMEDIA DENSITY #1 — ≥3 DISTINCT MEDIA TYPES PER ROUTE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

- Every page-rendered route MUST present ≥3 distinct media types — text-only pages are BUILD FAIL.
- Allowed types: photograph (GPT Image 2 OR real-entity); illustration/icon system; video (hero OR embedded clip); audio (podcast OR voiceover OR ambient); data visualization (chart OR infographic OR animated counter); 3D/WebGL (Three.js OR Spline OR particle field); interactive widget (calculator OR quiz OR map OR timeline scrubber); generative SVG (animated brand pattern).
- Distribution: hero — 1 media; feature section — 1-2 media; final CTA section — 1 media.
- Validator (`validate-multimedia-density.mjs`): grep dist HTML per route, assert ≥3 distinct types in: `<img>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<svg>` with animation, `<canvas>`, `<iframe data-media-embed>`.

## Every page (***MULTIMEDIA DENSITY #2 — VIDEO-FIRST IN HERO + 1 PER 1000 WORDS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

- Every site MUST ship ≥1 hero video AND ≥1 additional embedded video per ~1000 words of body content.
- Source order: source-site original videos (R2 self-hosted) → Veo 3.1 generation (premium tier) → Coverr royalty-free → Pexels free 4K → AI-generated explainer via HeyGen (founder profile only).
- All videos MUST be MP4 H.264 OR WebM VP9 ≤4MB, lazy-loaded via `<video preload="metadata">` + `loading="lazy"`, `autoplay+muted+playsinline+loop` ONLY for hero/ambient; embedded body videos require `<video controls>`. HLS permitted for videos >4MB.
