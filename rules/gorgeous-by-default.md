# Gorgeous By Default

Nothing ships plain. Every element a user can see gets a deliberate, beautiful, animated treatment — never the framework default, never raw text where a designed component belongs. Two non-negotiable halves: (1) **enumerable values render as pills, never comma-joined text**, and (2) **every interactive + decorative element is gorgeous, animated, and transitions at `0.333s`**.

## Half 1 — Enumerable values are ALWAYS pills (never `join(', ')`)

Any set of discrete, enumerable values rendered to the screen MUST be a row of styled pills / chips / badges — one per value. Comma-joining them into a sentence (`roles.join(', ')`, `tags.join(' · ')`, `"admin, donor, volunteer"`) is a build-fail-class mistake: it reads as raw data, not designed UI.

### What this covers (each value = its own pill)

- **Roles / permissions** — `admin · donor · super_admin · volunteer` → 4 pills
- **Tags / categories / topics / keywords**
- **Statuses / states** (`active`, `pending`, `paused`) — color-coded per state
- **Locales / languages** (`en · es · pt · ht`)
- **Services / programs / amenities offered**
- **Skills / interests / badges / achievements**
- **Filters currently applied** (removable pills with an `×`)
- **Any `string[]` shown to a user** — if it's an array, it's pills

### Pill contract (every pill)

- One pill per array item — `array.map(...)`, never `array.join(...)`
- Rounded-full, padded (`px-3 py-1`), small-but-legible type, `font-medium`
- Brand-token background + contrast-safe text per `text-contrast` (dark pill → light text; light pill → dark text)
- State-aware color where the value implies state (success/warn/danger/neutral)
- `0.333s` transition on hover/focus + a subtle lift or glow (`gorgeous-by-default` Half 2)
- Staggered entrance animation when the row first renders (per-pill delay) — reduced-motion-safe
- Accessible: the group has an `aria-label` (e.g. "Roles"); if pills are interactive they're real `<button>`/`<a>` with focus rings; if purely informational, a `<ul>`/`<li>` or `role="list"`
- Empty state is its own pill or a designed "None yet" affordance — never a bare word

### Anti-pattern (the exact mistake this rule kills)

```tsx
// ❌ raw CSV text — reads as a database dump
roles: {user.roles.join(', ')}

// ✅ one gorgeous pill per role
<ul aria-label="Roles" className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
  {user.roles.map((r, i) => (
    <li key={r} style={{ animationDelay: `${i * 60}ms` }}
        className="pill-enter rounded-full bg-maroon-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-medium text-maroon-900
                   transition-all duration-[333ms] hover:-translate-y-0.5 hover:bg-maroon-200 hover:shadow-md">
      {ROLE_LABEL[r] ?? r}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

## Half 2 — Everything gorgeous, animated, `0.333s`

Every element a user sees gets a deliberate, beautiful treatment. "Functional but plain" is incomplete per the user-level Progressively-Gorgeous UI Mandate — this rule operationalizes the per-element bar.

### The `0.333s` standard

- Default transition duration is **`0.333s`** (`duration-[333ms]` / `transition: ... 0.333s`) for hover, focus, enter, color, transform — unless a faster micro-interaction (≤150ms tap feedback) or a slower cinematic reveal is deliberately chosen
- Every interactive element declares a `transition` — no instant state jumps
- Pair every transition with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` honoring (snap to final state; never hide content)

### Per-element gorgeous checklist (apply to every element you render)

- **Transition** — `0.333s` on all state changes (hover/focus/active/enter)
- **Hover affordance** — lift (`-translate-y-0.5`), glow (`shadow-md`), or tint shift
- **Focus-visible ring** — brand-color ring ≥3:1, never the UA default outline
- **Focus/hover on WRAPPED controls** — when an `<input>`/control sits inside a styled wrapper (search bar = icon + input + `⌘K` kbd; combobox; segmented field), the affordance must surround the **whole wrapper**, not just the inner control. Put the ring on the wrapper via **`:focus-within`** (`.wrap:focus-within { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px }`) and **suppress the inner control's own ring** (`.wrap input:focus, :focus-visible { outline: none; box-shadow: none }`) so it isn't doubled or clipped to the bare input box. Mirror the same for hover: hover the wrapper (`.wrap:hover` / `.wrap:focus-within`), not just the input. Reference incident 2026-06-09 (projectsites /admin/apps search bar).
- **Entrance** — fade + 16px rise on first paint (`appReveal`/`@starting-style`), staggered for groups
- **Rounded + padded** — no flush, hard-edged framework defaults
- **Brand tokens** — never a hardcoded hex; OKLCH brand vars per `text-contrast`
- **Tabular-nums** on any number; rolling counters on stats per `cinematic-ui-patterns`
- **Reduced-motion + contrast-safe** — every animation gated; every text/element pair WCAG AA

### Where this applies

- Pills, chips, badges, tags, cards, buttons, links, inputs, toggles, avatars, stat blocks, list rows, table cells, nav items, modals, toasts, empty states, dividers, section headers — **every element**, not just the hero
- Admin + dashboard surfaces too — internal ≠ ugly. The /account, /admin, /me surfaces get the same gorgeous bar as marketing pages

### Widgets + popovers + overlays — fade-in-up entrance BY DEFAULT

Every widget that *appears* (AI-chat widget cards, command palettes, popover menus, dropdowns, toasts, sheets, dialogs, on-demand panels) gets a clean fade-in-up on mount — never a hard pop-in. This is the standard entrance; ship it on the widget's base class so it's automatic, not per-instance.

```css
/* Canonical widget entrance — fade + 12px rise. `both` holds the final state. */
@keyframes widget-in {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(12px); }
  to   { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
.widget, .popover, .menu, .toast, [data-widget] {
  animation: widget-in 380ms cubic-bezier(0.22, 0.9, 0.3, 1) both;
}
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .widget, .popover, .menu, .toast, [data-widget] { animation: none; }
}
```

- **Rise distance** 8–16px, **duration** 320–400ms, **easing** a soft ease-out (`cubic-bezier(0.22, 0.9, 0.3, 1)`). Groups stagger by document order (`animation-delay: calc(var(--i) * 60ms)`).
- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` → `animation: none`** — snap to final, never hide.
- **Re-render flicker guard**: if the widget container is rebuilt via `innerHTML` on every state change (chat re-render, live filter), a class-level entrance animation re-fires each rebuild → flicker. Either render the widget ONCE, or gate the animation to first mount (`@starting-style`, or animate only newly-appended nodes). See `cinematic-ui-patterns.md § the "list disappears" trap`.
- **⚠️ Stacking-context trap (z-index that "doesn't work")**: a `position:fixed` widget/popover that should float above page-level FABs (chat fab, cart fab) will be TRAPPED if any ancestor establishes a stacking context (`transform`, `filter`, `backdrop-filter`, `opacity<1`, `will-change`, `contain`, or `position`+`z-index`). Inside that ancestor NO z-index can paint above a higher-stacked body-level sibling — the whole subtree sits at the ancestor's z-index. Fix: **re-parent the fixed overlay to `document.body`** on init so its z-index competes at the body level (fixed positioning stays viewport-relative as long as no transformed ancestor remains). Verify with `document.elementFromPoint(cx, cy)` (real hit-test), NOT by reading the z-index number — the number can be right while the paint is wrong. Reference incident: music.megabyte.space 2026-06-17 (More menu / fullscreen lyrics / queue trapped inside `.app` at z:1, below the z:9990 cart FAB).

## Layout traps (silent visual bugs — verify every build)

### Subtitle/kicker spans must be `block` (never inline beside their title)

- An eyebrow/kicker/subtitle `<span>` that is `inline-block` (or default inline) can fall **on the same line as its title** when the title is also `inline-block` — two inline-blocks flow side-by-side if they fit. A kicker-above-title must be `block` so it always owns its own line.
- **`margin-top`/`mt-*` on an inline span is silently ignored** — if a span has `mt-*`, that's a tell it was meant to be `block` (the author expected vertical spacing that never applied).
- Fix at the shared component (`Eyebrow`/kicker) so it propagates; sweep raw subtitle spans too.
- Reference incident (nyfoldingbox.com, 2026-06-20): `Eyebrow` was `inline-block` and `SectionHeading`'s `<h2>` was also `inline-block` → eyebrow rendered inline beside the title. Fix: `Eyebrow` → `block`; three `mt-*` subtitle spans (meta/CTA/year-kicker) → `block`.

### SVG section dividers need an OPAQUE background (the section being LEFT)

- A wave/curve section divider that fills only its lower region with `color` leaves the **upper region transparent** — which shows the page/body background (usually white/cream). Against a **dark or brand** next-section that white band is jarring (looks like a gap that "should be" the section color).
- Fix: the divider's own `background` = the color of the section it's **leaving** (so the transparent region matches it); the SVG fill = the color of the section it's **entering** (so the wave flows into the next section). No transparency shows through.
- Reference incident (nyfoldingbox.com, 2026-06-20): kraft→dark `Curve` dividers showed a white band below the kraft section. Fix: added a `bg` prop (kraft) + set fill to the entered section (`#111` dark / `#3f1108` brand). Swept all 6 dividers, not just the flagged one.

## Self-critique (before shipping any element)

1. Is any `string[]` rendered as joined text? → convert to pills
2. Does every interactive element transition at `0.333s`? → add it
3. Does it have a hover affordance + focus-visible ring? → add them
4. Does every widget/popover/overlay fade-in-up on appear (not hard-pop)? → add `widget-in`
5. If it's a fixed overlay meant to float above FABs, is it re-parented to `<body>` (verified via `elementFromPoint`, not just z-index)? → fix the stacking-context trap
6. Is it reduced-motion-safe + contrast-safe? → gate + fix
7. Is every subtitle/kicker span `block` (not inline beside its title)? Any `mt-*` on an inline span? → make it `block` (see Layout traps)
8. Does every SVG section divider have an opaque bg matching the section it leaves (no white band into dark/brand)? → add the `bg` (see Layout traps)
9. Would Brian call it gorgeous, not just functional? → if no, iterate

## Beautify-10x loop + modifier matrix (Brian directive 2026-09-29)

- **Create, then beautify 10x in a row.** Whenever you create a UI element/section/screen, the creation is pass 0 — follow it with iterative "make it more gorgeous + beautiful" passes (target 10 cumulative) instead of shipping first-draft aesthetics. Each pass is a real diff (motion, type, depth, texture, layout rhythm, color), verified by screenshot + AI-vision score.
- **Revisit = more passes.** Any surface you touch again gets additional beautify passes until its matrix entry hits passes ≥10 AND aiVisionScore ≥9.5. Beauty is a ratchet, never done at "good enough".
- **Directed execution, bounded by evidence.** Each pass is `observe → critique → identify the single highest-value weakness → targeted fix → re-observe → compare` — never an arbitrary diff. 10 is a ceiling of ambition, not a quota. **Stop at a measured plateau** (independent critique stops surfacing high-value problems, or a change trades one strong dimension for another with no net gain) and **revert any pass that makes the surface worse**. Never add motion/effect merely to satisfy a pass. See `reference/aesthetic-quality-lexicon.md` §4.
- **Track state in a per-project `.claude/modifier-matrix.json`** — per-surface `{beautifyPasses, aiVisionScore, density, lastVisit, next[]}`. The orchestrator/loop reads it to decide WHEN to fire passes (lowest score × highest traffic first) and appends concrete `next` ideas while context is warm. Density axis 0-10 (marketing-airy → Coinbase-Pro cockpit) sets the intricacy target per surface class.
