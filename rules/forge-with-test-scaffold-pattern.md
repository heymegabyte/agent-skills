# Forge-with-Test-Scaffold Pattern

Every `forge-*` command MUST emit a paired test file alongside every generated source
file. The test goes RED first per `[[verification-loop]]`. A forge that ships source
code alone is incomplete — the user is left to remember tests later. They don't.

## The core rule

When any `/forge-*` command scaffolds new source code, it MUST also write:

- **E2E spec** (`e2e/<feature>/<name>.spec.ts`) when the output is a Hono route, OAuth
  callback, webhook handler, or any HTTP-reachable surface. Uses real Playwright against
  a local or PROD URL per `[[e2e-testing]]`.
- **Unit test** (`tests/<feature>/<name>.test.ts` or `<path>.test.ts` co-located) when
  the output is a typed client, utility module, schema transformer, or pure function.
  Uses Vitest 5 + `vi.fn()` — no network calls.
- **Both** when the output has a pure-function core consumed by an HTTP surface (e.g.
  an OpenAPI client used by a route — emit unit tests for the client AND a Playwright
  E2E for the route that calls it).

The test file is written in the SAME forge turn, immediately after the source files. It
is NOT deferred, NOT listed as a Rec, NOT left as a `TODO`. If the forge command's
execution section has Steps 1–N, the test step is Step N+1 (always last, never
optional).

## Mandatory test content

Every emitted test MUST contain at minimum:

1. **At least one failing assertion** — the test must be runnable and RED before the
   implementation is wired. A test that only `console.log` and passes vacuously is not
   a test.
2. **A clear `describe` label** matching the forged feature name and the forge command
   that created it. Example: `describe('/forge-graphql-skill: shopify queries', () => {`.
3. **The happy path** — the simplest successful invocation (correct input → correct
   output / HTTP 200 / expected JSON shape).
4. **At least one failure path** — invalid input, bad auth, malformed payload, or
   network error. The system must handle it gracefully.
5. **Cleanup** — `afterEach` / `afterAll` drops any test fixtures, DB rows, or temp
   files written during the run.

## Examples per forge command

- `/forge-from-openapi` → `tests/<skill-name>/client.test.ts`: Vitest unit tests mocking `fetch`, happy-path returns typed id, failure throws on non-2xx.
- `/forge-webhook-handler` → `tests/webhooks/<vendor>.test.ts`: valid sig passes, tampered payload rejects, stale replay timestamp rejects.
- `/forge-oauth-callback` → `e2e/oauth/<provider>.spec.ts`: Playwright against `PROD_URL`, code-exchange redirects to `/dashboard`, invalid state shows error.
- `/forge-graphql-skill` → typed query unit tests (`tests/`) AND Playwright E2E (`e2e/graphql/`).

See `reference/forge-with-test-scaffold-pattern.md` for full annotated code scaffolds for each forge command.

## Anti-patterns

- **Source-only forge** — a forge command that only emits `.ts` source files with no
  paired test. The engineer is left to write tests later. History shows: they don't.
  Any forge command shipped without test emission is a build-fail per `[[06-build-and-slice-loop]]`.
- **Passing vacuous tests** — a test that imports the module, calls nothing, and
  `expect(true).toBe(true)` is not a test scaffold; it is noise that hides the missing
  assertion. The RED→GREEN flow requires an assertion that can actually fail.
- **Deferring to Recs** — listing "add tests" in a Recommendations section instead of
  emitting them inline. Per `[[auto-integrate-recs]]`, <2h work ships inline. A test
  scaffold takes 5–15 minutes. It always ships inline.
- **Integration-only tests without unit coverage** — forging a complex client library
  with only an E2E that calls a live API. Network flakiness makes this unreliable. Always
  pair: unit tests mock the network, E2E confirms the real endpoint.

## New forge commands — checklist before shipping

A new `commands/forge-*.md` is NOT shippable until it satisfies:

- [ ] Execution section has a dedicated "Write test scaffold" step (numbered, mandatory)
- [ ] Step specifies: file path, test framework (Vitest vs Playwright), happy path +
      failure path coverage
- [ ] Generated test has `describe` label naming both the forge command and the feature
- [ ] Generated test is runnable RED without the implementation wired
- [ ] This rule file is cross-linked in the forge command's frontmatter or body
- [ ] `e2e/FEATURES.md` entry added for any Playwright spec emitted (per `[[e2e-testing]]`)

## Cross-links

- `[[verification-loop]]` — RED before GREEN is mandatory; forge tests are the RED step
- `[[e2e-testing]]` — directory layout, hermetic specs, 6-viewport × 3-browser matrix
- `[[06-build-and-slice-loop]]` — build slice = source + test; never source-only slice
- `[[auto-integrate-recs]]` — test scaffolds are never Recs; they always ship inline
- `[[conditional-ci-gates]]` — CI test run gates on spec presence (hashFiles pattern)
