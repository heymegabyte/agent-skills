# God-Tier Engineering Patterns

Every iteration ships ≥1 move a senior would call "right call." Code that works = floor. Code that makes next iteration faster, next bug rarer, next handoff cleaner = goal.

## The 10 patterns

### 1. Cross-iframe pointer sync via RAF-throttled postMessage

Parent cursor follower tracks inside iframe via `pointermove` → `requestAnimationFrame` → `parent.postMessage({type:'PS_CURSOR', x, y, hover}, PARENT_ORIGIN)`. Parent translates iframe-viewport coords via `iframe.getBoundingClientRect()`.

### 2. Master/detail accordion via AG Grid Community `fullWidthCellRenderer`

Never pay for AG Grid Enterprise. Insert synthetic row `_isDetail: true` after master; `isFullWidthRow` + `fullWidthCellRenderer` + `getRowHeight` toggles via signal.

### 3. Signal-driven `effect()` + `afterNextRender` for DOM teleport

Drive teleport from Angular signal `effect()`, NEVER `MutationObserver` on subtree you also mutate (infinite loop). On open → `afterNextRender` to move element; on close → remove. One render per state transition.

### 4. Synthetic placeholder-string test

String-based runtime contract (e.g. MutationObserver waiting for "Build a professional website for…") gets `e2e/{contract-name}.spec.ts` that fails build if string disappears upstream.

### 5. Per-instance brand-tokens override at end of cascade

Rebrand embedded third-party app via last-`@layer` `:root, :root[data-theme='dark']` remapping every `--vendor-*` to `--brand-*`. Plus brand-font import + selection/scrollbar/focus-ring overrides scoped to embed.

### 6. Computed-signal as event listener

`computed()` IS the event listener. Stop wiring `subscribe()` / `valueChanges`. `showChip = computed(() => this.scopeSlug() === this.initialScopeSlug)` + template `@if (showChip())`.

### 7. Worker-side encrypted env blob via AES-GCM + per-record IV

User-supplied secrets in D1: `crypto.subtle.importKey('raw', base64Decode(env.MCP_ENCRYPTION_KEY), 'AES-GCM', false, ['encrypt','decrypt'])`. Fresh 12-byte IV per write. Store `{ciphertext, iv}` base64.

### 8. Container DO w/ auto-restart 3/min + idle 30m hibernation + ring-buffer logs

Every Container DO caps restart at 3/rolling-minute, idle-hibernates after 30min, persists last 1000 log lines in SQLite ring buffer. Parent `Container` exposes `sleepAfter = '30m'`. Custom subclass adds `restart_count` + rolling-window check.

### 9. Browser Rendering REST API > Browser binding

Reach for CF's REST API (`/screenshot`, `/content`, `/snapshot`, `/scrape`) before binding-based npm package. Saves npm dep + binding declaration + redeploy. `fetch('https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{id}/browser-rendering/screenshot', { method:'POST', headers: {...}, body: JSON.stringify({url, viewport:{width:1920,height:1080}}) })`.

### 10. Regression test for "this model alias must keep existing"

Vitest spec walks `src/` recursively, greps model literal, asserts every match is on allowlist. Pair w/ account-level `GET /accounts/{id}/ai/models` snapshot test.

## Anti-patterns (don't repeat)

- **BSD `sed -i ''` with `\b`** silently matches NOTHING. Use Python `(?![A-Za-z0-9_-])` negative-lookahead.
- **Backticks inside ANY comment in an Angular component template literal close the string** — both CSS `/* … */` in `styles: [` AND HTML `<!-- … -->` in `template: \``. A stray `` ` `` ends the literal → `ng build` cascades (TS2304/TS2322); `tsc` tolerates it, so it's invisible until the build. Replace `` ` `` in comments with plain text. Gate BOTH (projectsites `frontend/scripts/check-css-comment-backticks.mjs` scans `styles:` CSS comments + `template:` HTML comments; `<!-- -->` delimiters are false-positive-safe, `/*` is scoped to `styles:` to avoid colliding with `accept="image/*"`). Bit twice: CSS comment (dashboard), HTML comment (api-tokens) — both 2026-09-06.
- **`aria-label="{{ }}"` in Angular** parses as literal string. Use `[attr.aria-label]="expr"`.
- **`MutationObserver` watching subtree you mutate** = infinite loop. Drive from signals + `afterNextRender`.
- **`opacity: 0` default with NO sibling rule flipping to `1`** renders invisible.
- **`iframe.allow="..."` missing `microphone`** blocks `getUserMedia({audio:true})` even if Permissions-Policy allows.
- **CFC `*.app.projectsites.dev` wildcard** needs Advanced Certificate Manager (paid). Use single-dash (`-app.projectsites.dev`) OR provision ACM up-front.
- **`<button>` NESTED inside `<button>`** is invalid HTML — the browser restructures the DOM, and a UnoCSS **masked icon** (`i-ph:*`, `background-color:currentColor` + `mask:var(--un-icon)`) in that broken position loses its mask and paints as a **solid `currentColor` square** (looked like a white square; only the NESTED control was affected — sibling non-nested icons rendered fine = the tell). Fix: make the inner control a keyboard-operable `<span role="button" tabIndex={0}>` (valid inside a button) + inline `<svg fill="currentColor">` (zero mask/CSP/data-URL dependency). Verify the computed `maskImage` is set BUT the icon still squares → it's the nesting, not the CSS.
- **Sharp `.clone()` shared across 3+ encoders silently empties the LAST pipeline.** `const base = sharp(buf).resize(...); await base.clone().jpeg().toBuffer(); await base.clone().webp().toBuffer(); await base.clone().avif().toBuffer();` produced a REAL jpg + webp but a **~100-byte empty AVIF** (the 3rd clone). Two clones worked; the third didn't — a size guard on only the first format let the blank AVIF ship, and since `<picture>`/ResponsivePicture serves AVIF FIRST, modern browsers render blank. Fix: a FRESH `sharp(buf)` per format (`const mk = () => sharp(buf).resize(...); await mk().jpeg()…; await mk().webp()…; await mk().avif()…`) — the input Buffer is reusable, so this is safe and cheap. ALWAYS guard EVERY output format's byte length (`jpg<8000 || webp<3000 || avif<3000 → throw`), never just one. (brickcitylabor `gen-guide-images.mjs`, 2026-08-29.)
- **React 19 DROPS a component's inline `<style>{cssString}</style>` on the CLIENT — the section ships UNSTYLED, silently (0 console errors).** React 19 treats `<style>` as a hoistable resource; a plain string-child `<style>` rendered inside a component body (client SPA, no SSR of that subtree) is not inserted into the DOM (`document.querySelectorAll('style')` never contains the scoped CSS). Symptom: a scoped section renders as raw unstyled markup — e.g. a stats band with `.sr-only` clip NOT applied shows the screen-reader value next to the visible one (`"500+500+"`), no grid/cards/gradient. Caught only by SCREENSHOTTING (or computed-style probing) the section, never by console/build. **Fix: component-scoped CSS MUST live in a LINKED stylesheet (the app's `index.css`), NEVER an inline `<style>{string}`.** Keep the prefixed classnames; just move the CSS. Grep `<style>{` across `src/components/**` = a template-wide smell (projectsites template had it in 22 components → all shipped unstyled). Alt if inline is unavoidable: add a `precedence` prop so React 19 hoists it (unverified; the linked-stylesheet move is guaranteed). (projectsites `template.projectsites.dev` fire-51, 2026-08-31.)
- **In-page anchor nav (`href="#section"`) lands WILDLY short on a long page with `content-visibility: auto` and/or lazy dimensionless media.** The browser computes the target's position ONCE at click, but off-screen `content-visibility:auto` sections render as their `contain-intrinsic-size` placeholder (e.g. `1200px`) while their real height is 2–5× that, and lazy `<img>`/`<video>` without `width`/`height` reserve 0 — so the document is thousands of px SHORTER than its true height and the smooth-scroll clamps far above the target (observed: clicked "Transmissions", landed **6463px short**; native `scrollIntoView` same). Removing the placeholder later (scrolling past) SHRINKS content above and yanks the target, so even a corrected jump then OVERSHOOTS. **Four-part fix, all needed:** (1) give every below-fold `<img>`/`<video>` explicit `width`/`height` (or CSS-reserved height) — kills the lazy-collapse AND fixes CLS; (2) `contain-intrinsic-size: auto <fallback>` (the `auto` keyword) so a section REMEMBERS its rendered size and doesn't re-collapse when it scrolls off — this is what stops the overshoot; (3) during the jump add a class that flips those sections to `content-visibility: visible !important` so the full height resolves at once, remove it once settled; (4) drive the scroll in JS with a per-frame **re-aim settle loop** (`want = target.top + scrollY - headerOffset`; `scrollTo(want)` each rAF for ~2.5s, cancel on user wheel/touch/key, and a `scrollSeq` token so a newer nav click supersedes the old loop instead of two loops fighting). Big jumps go `behavior:'auto'` (smooth across 40k px is slow); short hops stay smooth. Verify by MEASURING `target.getBoundingClientRect().top - headerHeight` after the scroll settles (must be ~0), never by eye. (ghost.megabyte.space, 2026-09-20 — nav re-prompted 3× before all four parts were in.)
- **Workers assets-first SWALLOWS browser navigations your worker meant to handle — and curl LIES green.** With an assets binding + `not_found_handling: single-page-application`, a navigation request (`Accept: text/html`) to a non-file path (`/login`) is served index.html by the asset layer WITHOUT invoking the worker; `curl` (`Accept: */*`) skips the SPA heuristic, reaches the worker, and passes your check while every real browser gets the wrong page. Fix: `assets.run_worker_first: ["/login", …]` for every worker-owned path; regression-test with browser headers (`Accept: text/html` + `Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate`), never bare curl. (megabyte.space /login → Access funnel, 2026-09-29.)
