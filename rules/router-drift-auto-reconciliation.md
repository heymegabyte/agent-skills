# Router Drift Auto-Reconciliation

`_router.md` is the live map the agent uses to resolve which skill handles a task. Orphan skills (on disk, absent from router) are invisible — they accumulate silently with no error, just degraded coverage.

Router reconciliation MUST be continuous, not periodic. Every skill submodule write triggers an immediate registration check. Manual `/audit-router --fix` is a fallback, not the baseline.

## Reference incident (2026-06-18)

`/audit-router --fix` found **51 orphan skills, 0 stale entries** after ~1 month of active development. PostToolUse hook `router-reconcile-on-skill-write.py` was wired the same turn.

## The hook

- **File:** `~/.claude/hooks/router-reconcile-on-skill-write.py`
- **Event:** `PostToolUse`
- **Matcher:** `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`
- **Trigger condition:** modified path matches `~/.claude/plugins/heymegabyte-agent-skills/[0-9]+-*/**.md` (excludes `SKILL.md`)

**Logic:**

1. Parse modified file path from stdin JSON (`tool_input.file_path`)
2. Extract `category_dir` and `slug`
3. Search `_router.md` for `` `slug` `` — if found, no-op
4. If not found: append `,`slug`` to the category's slug list in Category Map
5. If no category line exists: insert new Category Map entry
6. Write updated `_router.md`

**stderr output:**

- `router-reconcile: registered orphan {slug} in {category_dir}`
- `router-reconcile: no action needed ({slug})`
- `router-reconcile: skipping SKILL.md in {category_dir}`

**Override:** `CLAUDE_ROUTER_RECONCILE_DISABLE=1` suppresses hook for batch operations (mass imports, router rebuilds). Never leave set globally.

## What the hook does NOT do

- Does not remove stale entries — use `/audit-router --fix` (needs full filesystem glob)
- Does not update Task Routing rules — only Category Map slug lists
- Does not fire on `rules/*.md` or `SKILL.md`

Run `/audit-router --fix` for stale pruning or task routing updates (monthly cadence sufficient).

## Wiring in settings.json

See `reference/router-drift-auto-reconciliation.md` § Wiring for the exact `PostToolUse` block — matcher `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`, runs the reconcile hook alongside `enforce-tdd-e2e.py`, each `type: command` with `timeout: 5` and a `|| true` guard.

## Anti-patterns

- Relying on periodic manual audits — 51-orphan backlog is the result
- Running `/audit-router --fix` after every single skill write — hook replaces that
- Setting `CLAUDE_ROUTER_RECONCILE_DISABLE=1` globally

## Verification

See `reference/router-drift-auto-reconciliation.md` § Verification for the recipe: confirm the hook file exists, `jq` the `PostToolUse` block in settings.json, write a throwaway skill `.md` → grep `_router.md` for its slug → remove it.
