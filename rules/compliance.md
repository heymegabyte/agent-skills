# Compliance — License Isolation + Data-Subject Deletion

Two compliance concerns for any regulated build: keep strong-copyleft licenses from propagating into proprietary code, and automate data-subject deletion. (Consolidated 2026-09-26 from `agpl-isolation-via-http-boundary` + `right-to-deletion`.)

## AGPL Isolation via HTTP Boundary

When integrating an AGPL (or any strong-copyleft) service into a non-open codebase, isolate it behind a network boundary so copyleft never propagates to your application. The HTTP boundary is the license firewall.

### The rules

- Run the AGPL service as its **own process/container** — never inside your main app process.
- Communicate over **HTTP/RPC ONLY**. No `import`, no shared libraries.
- **No shared types** — types are code; copying them is importing the library. Re-declare all request/response shapes locally.
- **No shared DB tables or ORM schemas** — schema sharing is implicit coupling.
- **No AGPL packages in `package.json`**, including `devDependencies`.
- **Reading the source to learn patterns is safe** — copyleft triggers on INCLUSION of the code (modified or not) in your distributed work, not on reading it.
- Keep the integration surface **minimal** — fewer call sites = a cleaner firewall.

### Pattern

- Vendor service runs as a container on its own subdomain (e.g. `social.projectsites.dev`).
- A thin client (`src/services/<vendor>.ts`) calls it via `fetch` with a bearer token; every request/response shape is declared locally, not imported.
- Worker env carries only HTTP coordinates (`{VENDOR}_URL`, `{VENDOR}_API_KEY`, `{VENDOR}_SECRET`), never the vendor's SDK.

### Reference incident

projectsites.dev Postiz (AGPL social scheduler) at `social.projectsites.dev` — HTTP-only client (`src/services/postiz.ts`), no `@gitroom/*` packages, no shared types/schema. Patterns studied from source; zero code included. See `docs/SERVICES-AND-SOCIAL.md` § Postiz.

## Right to Deletion — GDPR Art. 17 + CCPA + LGPD Cascade

Every project storing PII MUST implement automated deletion via CF Workflows v2. Manual deletion is a compliance liability.

### When this fires

- Any project with a D1 `users` table AND at least one of: Stripe/Square records, R2 uploads, Vectorize embeddings, listmonk/PostHog/Sentry user records.
- Before first deployment of any user-account feature.
- GDPR applies to EU residents' data regardless of server location.

### Legal SLA

| Regulation | Deadline | Exception |
|---|---|---|
| GDPR Art. 17 | 30 days (extendable 60 more with notice) | Legal obligation, public interest, archiving |
| CCPA / CPRA | 45 days (extendable 45 more) | Security, fraud detection, legal obligation |
| LGPD (Brazil) Art. 18 | Immediate or at next feasible moment | Legal basis persists |

- **Target: complete cascade within 24 hours of intake.** 30-day SLA is for extreme edge cases only.

### Intake channels (all three REQUIRED)

#### 1. Web form (self-serve)

- Hono route `POST /account/delete` with `DeletionRequestSchema` (`email`, optional `reason`, `turnstileToken`).
- Verify Turnstile before touching any user data — prevents abuse.
- Verify Clerk session ownership; if no session, send a signed email-confirmation token instead.
- On verified request: create CF Workflow instance immediately (durable from that moment) + write `deletion_audit` row with `status='pending'`.

See `reference/right-to-deletion.md` for the full implementation.

#### 2. Email intake (DSR@yourdomain.com)

- Wire CF Email Workers (or Amazon SES inbound) to `POST /internal/deletion-email`.
- Parse subject for "delete my account" / "right to erasure" / "RTBF"; auto-queue the Workflow.
- Reply with confirmation email within **5 minutes**.
- Parse body with Workers AI (`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct`) to extract requester email and intent.

#### 3. Admin dashboard

- `/admin/deletion-requests` — lists `deletion_audit` rows, shows status (`pending|running|complete|failed`), allows manual trigger.
- Use `[[feature-flags]]` with key `deletion_dashboard`, `stage='beta'` at launch.

### Cascade entities (ordered by dependency)

```
1. Clerk session invalidation → revoke all sessions for email
2. KV cache purge           → namespace:user:{id}:*
3. D1 application rows      → FK-ordered batch delete (sessions → oauth_accounts → notifications → feature_flag_overrides → users)
4. Vectorize embeddings     → by external_id = user.id
5. R2 uploaded files        → by prefix users/{id}/  (paginate with cursor until not truncated)
6. Stripe customer.delete   → if customer_id exists
7. Square customer archive  → if square_customer_id exists
8. listmonk subscriber remove → by email from all lists (hard-delete, not blocklist)
9. PostHog person delete    → by distinct_id
10. Sentry user delete      → by username/email
11. Audit log UPDATE        → mark complete, preserve required fields only
```

Every step in the CF Workflow uses `retries: { limit: 3 }`. See `reference/right-to-deletion.md` for the full `DeletionCascade` WorkflowEntrypoint.

### Receipt email (Amazon SES)

- Send from `privacy@yourdomain.com`; subject: `"Your data has been deleted — [date]"`.
- Body MUST state: (1) request received date, (2) completion date, (3) what was deleted, (4) what was retained and why, (5) contact for disputes.
- Mark `X-Category: transactional` — exempt from unsubscribe requirement.

See `reference/right-to-deletion.md` for the `sendDeletionReceipt` implementation.

### Audit log — what MUST survive

- GDPR Art. 17(3)(b) + Art. 5(2) require proof of deletion. Store email hash (SHA-256), never plaintext.
- Retain audit rows for **3 years** (statute of limitations for most EU privacy claims).
- **Retained fields (all non-personal):** `id`, `email_hash` (SHA-256 of lowercase email), `requested_at`, `completed_at`, `channel`, `status`.
- **Must NOT persist:** name, phone, address, device IDs, IP address, plaintext email, any behavioral data.
- Add DDL to a migration file; `DO NOT` add an `email` column. See `reference/right-to-deletion.md` for the full `deletion_audit` DDL.

### wrangler.jsonc binding

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc — add to existing bindings
{
  "workflows": [
    {
      "name": "DELETION_WORKFLOW",
      "binding": "DELETION_WORKFLOW",
      "class_name": "DeletionCascade",
      "script_name": "your-worker-name"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Drift detection

- `grep -rn 'users.*INSERT\|users.*UPDATE' src/worker/` — every new user-data write needs a deletion step added to the Workflow.
- Monthly: query `deletion_audit` for `status='failed'` rows; investigate and rerun.
- Annually: verify all third-party deletion APIs still work (Stripe, Square, listmonk, PostHog, Sentry endpoints change).
