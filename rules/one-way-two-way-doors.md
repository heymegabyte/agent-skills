# One-Way vs Two-Way Doors

Classify every architectural decision before writing any code.

## Two-way door (reversible within a sprint)

Undo in hours–days without user impact or coordinated migration. Move fast.

Examples: adding a D1 column (with default), adding a Hono route, wrapping a feature behind a flag, changing Tailwind classes, adding a KV namespace, switching npm packages with equivalent APIs, adding a Zod schema/cron/`console.log`.

## One-way door (painful or impossible to undo)

Undoing requires coordinated migration, data loss risk, public announcement, or >1 sprint. Write the self-argument. Proceed with explicit intent.

Examples: dropping a D1 column (data loss), choosing an auth provider (Clerk → migration = weeks), defining a public API surface, choosing a database engine, choosing a data model encoding a business assumption, migrating CF jurisdictions (GDPR), deleting an R2 bucket, changing a URL structure without redirect strategy, Stripe vs Square choice, adding a non-nullable column without default.

## Decision protocol

- **Two-way** → classify → ship autonomously per `[[autonomous-engineering]]` tier. No ceremony. Move.
- **One-way** → classify → 5-minute written self-argument → document → decide → ship.
- **Self-argument template (inline comment or ADR)** — fields: Decision · Type · For · Against · Counterargument-defeated? · Confidence (≥0.7 to proceed) · Proceed. See `reference/one-way-two-way-doors.md` for the fill-in template + a worked example.
- Write in the commit message or `docs/decisions/NNN-title.md` for anything larger than a 2-file change.

## Common misclassifications

- **Add D1 column with DEFAULT** — two-way (non-breaking; reversible by dropping)
- **Drop D1 column** — one-way (data loss; cannot recover from git history)
- **Add feature flag** — two-way (deleted in a single row delete)
- **Change public REST route** — one-way (consumers exist; requires deprecation + redirect)
- **Switch Clerk to Auth0** — one-way (user session migration = weeks; JWKs change)
- **Add new R2 bucket** — two-way (empty bucket deleted in seconds)
- **Delete R2 bucket with data** — one-way (permanent data loss)
- **Add `UNIQUE` constraint to D1** — one-way (fails if duplicates exist; requires backfill)

## Confidence threshold

Confidence below 0.7 on a one-way door → research more before deciding. State confidence explicitly in the self-argument.

## Amplifiers

- Per `[[no-staging-doctrine]]`: every one-way door mistake is immediately a production incident — the 5-minute pause is proportionate.
- Per `[[drift-detection]]`: an architectural choice with no documented rationale → add one the same turn. Undocumented one-way doors are the hardest drift to unwind.

## Anti-patterns

- Treating a schema drop as two-way ("we can add it back") — git restores the definition, not the data.
- Treating an auth provider choice as two-way ("it's just an API") — JWT format, sessions, OAuth, MFA are deeply coupled.
- Skipping the self-argument because "this one is obvious" — obvious choices with no counterargument check are where the worst surprises live.
- Writing the self-argument in Slack — undiscoverable.
- Classifying everything as two-way to avoid the 5-minute pause — wrong one-way door costs weeks.

## Cross-links

- `[[autonomous-engineering]]` — approval tiers; one-way doors are approval-required by default
- `[[no-staging-doctrine]]` — no staging safety net; one-way door mistakes hit prod immediately
- `[[drift-detection]]` — one-way doors without documentation become opaque drift
- `[[data-residency-by-default]]` — jurisdiction selection is a one-way door
- `[[fail-fast-build-fail-soft-prod]]` — build gates catch one-way door mistakes before prod
