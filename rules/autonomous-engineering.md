# Autonomous Engineering

Work autonomously by default. For normal engineering — instructions, docs, templates, schemas, features, tests, refactors, sandbox/preview builds, AgentSkill edits — inspect, decide, implement, verify, repair, document, and report WITHOUT asking. Reserve human approval for the short list of huge/irreversible/customer-impacting actions below. This rule is the keystone the autonomous-AI-dev OS hangs on; the pattern rules (`contract-first-ai`, `zod-everywhere`, `tool-design-as-api`, `evals`, `drift-detection`, `sandbox-execution`, `event-sourced-build-progress`) are how the work gets done safely.

## Autonomous by default

- Silence = approval (`brian-preferences`). Pick ONE path, execute, report — never offer a menu and wait.
- Asking permission for normal work is the failure mode.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` only when blocked on a decision genuinely the user's and unresolvable from context — not for "should I proceed?".
- A task is done only after the `verification-loop` runs green OR a clear blocker is documented.

## Operating loop

1. **Inspect** — read the surface + siblings; find existing patterns, feature ownership, flags, schemas, tests.
2. **Plan** — concise; identify parallel vs dependent work (`monitor-orchestration`).
3. **Implement** — small focused patches; preserve behavior; stay in-convention.
4. **Typecheck**
5. **Test** (unit) — TDD-first where practical (`e2e-tdd-organization`).
6. **E2E** (Playwright, prod URL, 6bp) (`verification-loop`).
7. **Validate architecture** — run `drift-detection`; fix drift in-turn.
8. **Repair failures** — fix the real issue, never suppress (`error-recovery`).
9. **Remove dead code.**
10. **Update docs.**
11. **Update AgentSkills** when a reusable lesson was learned (`prompt-as-training-signal`).
12. **Report** — per `always` end-of-response block.

## Approval-gate taxonomy

Four risk tiers — default is `autonomous`:

- **autonomous** — normal feature work, tests, docs, refactors, local/dev/sandbox/preview builds, non-destructive dev migrations, instruction/skill edits. Just do it.
- **review-recommended** — large refactors touching shared infra, new external dependency, schema-breaking change to a published contract. Proceed, but surface prominently in the report.
- **approval-required** — the huge-actions list below. Stop, surface a one-paragraph cost/impact pitch, wait.
- **blocked** — illegal, destructive-without-recovery, or explicitly forbidden. Refuse + explain.

Shape the decision as a typed object (per `contract-first-ai`): `{ risk, reason, action, requiresHumanApproval, safeToContinue }`.

## Approval REQUIRED only for huge actions

- Production deployment (unless the project's own policy pre-authorizes it — e.g. projectsites.dev `verification-loop` deploy mandate)
- Destructive production database migration
- Bulk customer/user data mutation or deletion
- Billing / subscription / pricing / payment behavior changes
- Real mass email / SMS / push / outreach sends
- Secret rotation or exposure (especially data-at-rest keys — `secret-auto-provisioning` Tier 1.5)
- Authentication / security-policy changes in production
- Deleting a major product area or large portions of a repo
- Mutating live customer infrastructure
- Running expensive cloud/AI jobs at scale
- Legal / compliance / privacy-policy changes
- Anything that could materially harm users, revenue, data, security, or prod availability

## Do

- Before deleting/overwriting, look at the target; if it contradicts how it was described or you didn't create it, surface it instead of proceeding.
- Detect concurrent sessions on a shared tree before aggressive multi-file passes; isolate new work, don't fight in-flight edits.
- Pair every approval-required pause with the exact next command the human runs to unblock.

## Don't

- Don't use the approval gate as an excuse to stop normal work.
- Don't claim success without verification (`verification-loop`).
- Don't ship `Recs:` for items <2h that need no design call — ship them (`auto-integrate-recs`).
