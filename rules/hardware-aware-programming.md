# Hardware-Aware Programming

CF Workers run on V8 isolates. Cold-start ~5ms. Every I/O call must justify its existence.

Three questions before every I/O call — if you cannot answer "no" to all three, implement the optimization before shipping:

1. Can this be cached?
2. Can this be batched with adjacent calls in the same request?
3. Can this be deduplicated (same data already fetched this request)?

## Rules

- D1 reads sit behind KV (60s TTL) — never hit D1 twice for the same record in one request.
- PostHog events buffered and flushed via `ctx.waitUntil()` — never `await` analytics in the critical path.
- R2 object reads flow through the CF Cache API — CDN edge is the first cache layer.
- AI Gateway calls deduplicated by request hash — identical prompts in the same request get one upstream call.
- `fetch()` to external APIs uses a per-request `Map` as a dedup registry — same URL + body returns the in-flight promise.

## Correct patterns

- `cachedD1<T>(kv, key, ttlSeconds, fallback)` — KV get-or-fallback with `expirationTtl`. Place in `worker/lib/kv-cache.ts`.
- `trackEvent(ctx, event, props)` — wraps PostHog capture in `ctx.waitUntil(fetch(...))`. Never top-level `await`.
- R2 handler: check `caches.default.match(cacheKey)` first; on miss, set `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` and `waitUntil(caches.default.put(...))`.
- `createDedupFetch()` — returns a closure over a per-request `Map<string, Promise<Response>>`; register as Hono middleware. Place in `worker/lib/dedup-fetch.ts`.
- `dedupAiCall<T>(env, model, messages)` — SHA-256 hash of `model + JSON.stringify(messages)` as dedup key. Place in `worker/lib/ai-gateway.ts`.

See `reference/hardware-aware-programming.md` for all implementations.

## Anti-patterns

- `db.select()` on every request with no KV cache layer.
- `await fetch('https://us.i.posthog.com/capture/', ...)` in the hot path — adds 50–200ms to every P99.
- Two identical `fetch()` calls to the same URL in one handler — two round trips, two billing units.

## Checklist

- Every `db.select()`: KV key assigned. If not, add one before merging.
- Every PostHog/analytics call: wrapped in `ctx.waitUntil()`, never top-level `await`.
- Every `env.BUCKET.get()`: CF Cache API checked first.
- Every external `fetch()` in a request handler: routed through `dedupFetch`.
- Every `env.AI.run()`: hash-deduplicated if called more than once per request lifecycle.
- `db.batch([])` used for any handler issuing ≥2 writes — never individual awaited inserts.
- KV TTLs by data freshness: user profiles 60s, config 300s, static catalog 3600s.
- No `await` on non-critical post-response work — use `ctx.waitUntil()`.

## Cold-start budget

- Isolate initialization to module-level (`const db = drizzle(env.DB)`) — not per-request constructors.
- Import only what the route needs; large SDK imports add parse time on cold start.
- Use `wrangler types` bindings — avoid runtime type coercion overhead on every binding access.
- CPU: free 10ms/request; paid default 30s (configurable to 5 min). Awaits don't accrue CPU (CPU ≠ wall). An uncached D1 read ~8ms wall, near-zero CPU — free tier dies on parsing, not proxying.
