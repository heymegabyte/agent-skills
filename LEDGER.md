# LEDGER — Auditable Learning Record

Every meaningful durable change is logged here. Future agents read this to understand why the system is shaped as it is.

> **Active re-architecture loop:** see [`_REARCH_LEDGER.md`](_REARCH_LEDGER.md) for the 14-workstream plan + convergence state. Read it FIRST on any skill-library re-architecture fire.

## 2026-06-30T04:52:00Z — Agent Operating System bootstrap

- **Trigger phrase:** "Implement a durable, self-improving agent operating system"
- **Classification:** new-capability
- **Destination:** AGENTSKILLS.md, LEDGER.md, routing-matrix.md, 3 policy files, 10 prompts, 4 templates, archives/, 8 skills, Stop hook, settings.json, CLAUDE.md, 4 project docs, 4 project skills
- **Files changed:** ~42 files created across ~/.agentskills/, ~/.claude/, and project
- **Why this belongs here:** This IS the bootstrap of the self-improving OS. Everything starts here.
- **Why this is not overfit:** Built on existing Emdash OS v6.1 infrastructure. Additive, not replacement. All routes point to existing canonical locations.
- **Repo sync performed:** yes — megabyte.space got project-level skills and agent philosophy docs
- **Verification:** JSON valid, shell syntax clean, all files exist, git diff reviewed
- **Follow-up risk:** Stop hook may need tuning after real-world use. Prompt library will need pruning within 30 days.
- **Retrospective marker:** RETROSPECTIVE_DONE session=bootstrap turn=0

## 2026-06-30T04:52:01Z — Routing matrix codified

- **Trigger phrase:** User specified exact routing rules in the operating system spec
- **Classification:** philosophy-change
- **Destination:** routing-matrix.md
- **Files changed:** ~/.agentskills/routing-matrix.md
- **Why this belongs here:** Formalizes the implicit routing that was scattered across CLAUDE.md, prompt-as-training-signal.md, and _router.md
- **Why this is not overfit:** Decision table pattern, not narrative. Easy to add rows without rewriting.
- **Repo sync performed:** no (global-only artifact)
- **Verification:** Cross-referenced against existing routing in prompt-as-training-signal.md
- **Follow-up risk:** New destination types (e.g., MCP tools as skills) may need new rows
- **Retrospective marker:** RETROSPECTIVE_DONE session=bootstrap turn=0

## 2026-06-30T04:52:02Z — Prompt library created

- **Trigger phrase:** "Maintain about 10 canonical saved markdown prompts over time"
- **Classification:** new-capability
- **Destination:** prompts/00-index.md + 10 prompt files
- **Files changed:** ~/.agentskills/prompts/*.md (11 files)
- **Why this belongs here:** Prompt library was a named gap. No equivalent existed.
- **Why this is not overfit:** 10-prompt cap with merge-before-create prevents bloat. Archives/ path for superseded prompts.
- **Repo sync performed:** yes — project docs/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md explains repo relationship
- **Verification:** All 10 prompts have trigger phrases, when/not-to-use sections, and full copy-pasteable prompts
- **Follow-up risk:** Prompts 08-10 may be too broad. Watch for under-use and archive aggressively.
- **Retrospective marker:** RETROSPECTIVE_DONE session=bootstrap turn=0

## 2026-09-25 — Skill-library re-architecture loop, Phase 1 (forged-command collapse)

- **Trigger phrase:** `/loop` — "re-architect + compress every skill in ~/.claude and ~/.agentskills; fewer files, less space, better for AI"
- **Classification:** new-capability + drift-fix
- **Destination:** `bin/collapse-forged-commands.mjs` (new tool), `_REARCH_LEDGER.md` (new steering doc), `skills/*/SKILL.md` (local pointers)
- **Files changed:** `bin/collapse-forged-commands.mjs`, `_REARCH_LEDGER.md`, `LEDGER.md`; locally (gitignored `skills/`) removed 4,154 forged `commands/*.md` across 8 integrations + added a pointer to each `SKILL.md`
- **Why this belongs here:** First fire of the re-architecture loop. Established the map (two populations: hand-authored doctrine vs forge-generated API refs), the 14-workstream plan, and executed the largest, safest reduction: 4,720→566 md files (−88%), 406,259→92,228 lines (−77%).
- **Why this is not overfit:** The removed pages were generated, gitignored, unrouted, and duplicated by live MCP + Context7; the generator + typed clients + SKILL.md inventories remain, so it re-forges losslessly. The collapse tool is idempotent + reusable for any future forged skill.
- **Repo sync performed:** no (global agent-config only)
- **Verification:** `git status` clean pre-change; dry-run matched apply (4,154); post: `find skills -name '*.md'` = 8 SKILL.md; rules/ (160) + reference/ (42) + numbered skills untouched; all 8 SKILL.md carry the collapse pointer.
- **Follow-up risk:** Re-forge overwrites the local SKILL.md pointer (acceptable — it also restores `commands/`). Doctrine workstreams 2–14 still pending; contradiction recon must be verified per-item (fonts flag was a false positive).
- **Retrospective marker:** RETROSPECTIVE_DONE session=loop-rearch turn=1
